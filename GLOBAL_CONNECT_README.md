## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- Modern web browser with WebRTC support
- Camera and microphone access

### Installation

1. **Clone or navigate to the project:**
```bash
cd /workspace  # You're already here
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the development server:**
```bash
npm start
```

4. **Open your browser:**
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### 🎮 How to Use

1. **Enter your name** in the lobby
2. **Choose a room ID** (or leave blank for random)
3. **Select your language** for translation
4. **Click "Join Call"** to enter the video room
5. **Share the room ID** with others to join

### 🎛️ Call Controls

| Button | Function |
|--------|----------|
| 🎤 | Toggle microphone on/off |
| 📹 | Toggle camera on/off |
| 🖥️ | Share/stop screen sharing |
| 💬 | Open/close chat sidebar |
| 📞 | End call and return to lobby |

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Backend (Node.js + Socket.IO)
- **Express.js** web server serving static files
- **Socket.IO** for real-time signaling and messaging
- **Room management** with user presence tracking
- **Message persistence** and chat history
- **Health monitoring** and graceful shutdown

### Frontend (Vanilla JavaScript + WebRTC)
- **Modern ES6+ class-based architecture**
- **WebRTC PeerConnection** management
- **Media stream handling** for video/audio
- **Speech recognition integration**
- **Responsive glassmorphism UI**

### WebRTC Signaling Flow
1. **User joins room** → Server assigns to room
2. **Signaling server** exchanges offers/answers
3. **ICE candidates** establish peer connections
4. **Direct P2P** communication for media streams
5. **Server relays** chat and caption data
