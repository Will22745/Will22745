<h2>üß† Bio</h2>
<p>
I'm Willie McClain ‚Äî a lifelong learner and dedicated problem solver driven by curiosity and a passion for technology. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a focus in Cybersecurity from Capella University and am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Western Governors University. 
</p>
<p>
Through hands-on personal projects and home lab experiments, I‚Äôm building real-world experience in areas like cybersecurity, automation, and applied AI. The purpose of this portfolio is to take my theoretical knowledge and transform it into practical, demonstrable skills. It‚Äôs also a way for me to showcase my growth and capabilities to potential employers, mentors, friends, and family.
